# Instagram (Un)Follow

Using JSON files provided by Instagram make a list of people who don't follow you back.

### Project's motivation

Managing social media relationships, particularly on platforms like Instagram, is increasingly important in both personal and professional contexts. People want to know who follows them back or identify accounts that they follow but do not reciprocate. This tool provides a practical solution to automate the tedious process of manually checking followers and followings, making social media management more efficient. It's a project that has immediate real-world utility for users, from influencers to businesses, or even personal account holders.

### Learning goals
1. `JSON Parsing`: The project involves handling Instagramâ€™s exported data in JSON format, which is a widely-used format for data representation. Parsing and working with JSON files is a key skill in modern development.
2. `C# and Windows Forms`: Developing a desktop application using C# and Windows Forms allows me to explore graphical user interface (GUI) design, event-driven programming, and how to present data interactively.
3. `ListView and Dynamic UI`: Implementing dynamic components such as the ListView to display user data, including profile links, adds complexity and an interactive element to the tool, offering opportunities to improve my UI/UX development skills.
